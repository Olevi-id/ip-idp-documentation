title: Identity Provider reference
---
[Olevi](https://www.olevi.fi/) Identity Provider is OIDC/SAML2 compatible implementation, based on [Shibboleth IdP](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDP4/overview) open source software.

During the span of few years, the solution has evolved based on discussions and experience on clients’ needs. The solution is modular, container based and driven by thoroughly developed and constantly improving devOps automation.

The IdP Solution, as its open source upstream big brother software product, is a reference implementation and a laboratory to research authentication mechanisms needed in commercial enterprises today. Our intention is to find the best match to client’s need based on our thorough experience. Whether the product is from our own keyboard or from a friend’s or partner’s, we value the effort equally. There is a tool for each task.
